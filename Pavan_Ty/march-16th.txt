What is difference between comparable and comparator
Comparable provides a single sorting sequence. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price
 Comparable is present in java.lang package.
The Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
A Comparator is present in the java.util package.

what are the underlying ds for linked list arraylist in java?
ArrayList is a resizable array implementation in java.The backing data structure of ArrayList is an array of Object class.
When creating an ArrayList you can provide initial capacity then the array is declared with the given capacity. The default capacity value is 10.

Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at the contiguous location, the elements are linked using pointers as 
In Java, LinkedList can be represented as a class and a Node as a separate class

is arrayindexoutof bound and indexoutofbound same?
IndexOutOfBoundsException is the super class of ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException (thrown when accessing invalid index in a array) and 
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException (thrown when accessing invalid index in a String).

predefined functions in collections
addAll()-	It is used to adds all of the specified elements to the specified collection.
binarySearch()-It searches the list for the specified object and returns their position in a sorted list.
checkedList()-It is used to returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified list.
checkedMap()-It is used to returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified map.
copy()-	It is used to copy all the elements from one list into another list.
max()-	It is used to get the maximum value of the given collection,

what are the advantages and disadvatages of array list?

Advantages:

ArrayList is variable length.
Add any type of data into ArrayList.
Traverse in both directions.
Insert and remove elements also at particular position of ArrayList.
ArrayList allows multiple null values.
ArrayList allows to add duplicate elements.
ArrayList has many methods to manipulate stored objects.
When ArrayList exceeds its capacity, then its size increases by 50%.
Retrieval is faster in ArrayList

Disadvantages:
If a data entry is added to or removed from an array-based list,
 data needs to be shifted to update the list.

what are iterators and cursors

An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet. 
A Java Cursor is an Iterator, which is used to iterate or traverse or retrieve a Collection or Stream objectâ€™s elements one by one

can catch be return without try in java?
Yes, we can have try without catch block by using finally block. You can use try with finally.
 As you know finally block always executes even if you have exception or return statement in try block except in case of System.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
can try be return catch in java?
Whenever try-block executes successfully, then it can always return value from end of method. 
If any exception is raised from try-block then it get caught in the corresponding catch-block and catch-block can also return value
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can we use finally without try catch in Java?
A finally block must be associated with a try block, you cannot use finally without a try block. 
You should place those statements in this block that must be executed always
