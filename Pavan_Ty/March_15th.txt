what is difference b/w constructor and fucntion in the class
 Constructor is used to initialize an object whereas method is used to exhibits functionality of an object.
Constructor does not return any value where the method may/may not return a value.
In case constructor is not present, a default constructor is provided by java compiler. In the case of a method, no default method is provided.
Constructor should be of the same name as that of class. Method name should not be of the same name as that of class.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
who gives default constructor
jvm gives default constructor
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what are other responsibilities if jvm
What the JVM is used for. The JVM has two primary functions: to allow Java programs to run on any device or operating system (known as the "Write once, run anywhere" principle), 
and to manage and optimize program memory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is java call by reference or call by value
Java uses only call by value while passing reference variables as well. It creates a copy of references and passes them as valuable to the methods.
 As reference points to same address of object, creating a copy of reference is of no harm.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

what happens if final keyword is applied on variable,class and method?
 If we initialize a variable with the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
why string is passed in main method?
: Because by passing String arrays , we can pass all the necessary parameters like options/arguments related to the program in the form of String easily.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
why only jvm gives default constructor?
 because the default constructor is used to provode the default values and this is done by the java compiler. the java compiler is the part of jvm.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
who provides extra functions in main method??
the packages and libraries present in jvm.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
difference b/w java 8 and java7
Java 7 brings JVM support for dynamically-typed languages plus Type Interference for Generic Instance creation. 
Java 8 brings the most anticipated feature for the programming language called Lambda Expressions,
 a new language feature which allows users to code local functions as method arguments
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when and why collections were added

Java Collection enables the user to perform various data manipulation operations like storing data, 
searching, sorting, insertion, deletion, and updating of data on the group of elements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
difference b/w collection and collections
Collection: Collection is a interface present in java.util.package. It is used to represent a group of individual objects as a single unit
Collections: Collections is a utility class present in java.util.package. It defines several utility methods 
like sorting and searching which is used to operate on collection. It has all static methods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
why the output is showing false????
Ans: as the return type is mentioned boolean, no matter what, the false will only be returned.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between c and java access specifiers?
there is no access specifires in c whereas there are four access modifiers in java.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
which inheritance is not supported by java?
Java doesn't allow multiple inheritance to avoid the ambiguity caused by it
